Tabular time series data presented in the manuscript.

Raster data are from [NASA data archive](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data) services (e.g., [landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/), [modis](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/)) and ESA data services. 

Data are also hosted as [Google Earth Engine Collections](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/). 

Raster data downloads can be replicated using our example `/python/*.py` scripting and `/rmd/*.Rmd` notebooks in the GitHub.

Previously extracted data are stored as `.csv` and geotiff `.tif` files on [CyVerse Data Store](https://data.cyverse.org/dav-anon/tswetnam/emsi).

R Markdown notebooks are provided in this repo which will extract and render these data as figures used in the main text.

Code, data, and recipes are hosted on [CyVerse DataCommons](https://datacommons.cyverse.org/browse/iplant/home/tswetnam/emsi).

Original commercial imagery are available from [Planet.com](https://planet.com).
