Tabular time series data presented in the manuscript.

Raster data are from [NASA data archive](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data) services (e.g., [landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/), [modis](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/)) and ESA data services. Data are also hosted as [Google Earth Engine Collections](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/). These raster data can be extracted to your local computer using our example `/python/*.py` scripting and `/rmd/*.Rmd` notebooks.

Previously extracted data are stored as `.csv` and geotiff `.tif` files on [CyVerse Data Store](https://data.cyverse.org/dav-anon/tswetnam/emsi), and R Markdown notebooks are provided in this repo which wil extract and render these data as the tables and figures used in the main text.

Additional derivative imagery layers from Google Earth Engine (GEE) are hosted on [CyVerse DataCommons](http://datacommons.cyverse.org/).

Original commercial imagery are available from [Planet.com](https://planet.com).
